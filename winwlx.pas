    WLX_SAS_ACTION_SHUTDOWN_HIBERNATE Shuts down the system into the hibernate mode. If the system was not configured for hibernation, this option will have no effect.

  Remarks
  Winlogon calls WlxLoggedOnSAS when the logged-on user wants to shut down, log out, or lock the workstation. The GINA DLL can lock the workstation by returning WLX_SAS_LOCK_WKSTA. When this value is returned, Winlogon locks the workstation and calls WlxWkstaLockedSAS the next time it receives an SAS.

  Before calling WlxLoggedOnSAS, Winlogon sets the desktop and workstation states as follows.Sets the So that
  Desktop state The current desktop is the Winlogon desktop.
  Workstation state The desktop is locked.
}

  TWlxLoggedOnSAS = function (AWlxContext: Pointer; ASasType: DWORD; AReserved: Pointer): Integer; stdcall;

{ WlxLoggedOutSAS
  Winlogon calls this function when it receives a SAS event while no user is logged on.

  Parameters
  pWlxContext         Pointer to the GINA context associated with this window station. The GINA returns this context value when Winlogon calls WlxInitialize for this station.
  dwSasType           Specifies the type of SAS that occurred. Values from zero to WLX_SAS_TYPE_MAX_MSFT_VALUE are reserved to define standard Microsoft SAS types. GINA developers can define additional SAS types using values greater than WLX_SAS_TYPE_MAX_MSFT_VALUE.
    WLX_SAS_TYPE_CTRL_ALT_DEL Indicates that a user has typed the standard CTRL+ALT+DEL secure attention sequence (SAS).
    WLX_SAS_TYPE_SC_INSERT Indicates that a smart card has been inserted into a compatible device.
    WLX_SAS_TYPE_SC_REMOVE Indicates that a smart card has been removed from a compatible device.
    WLX_SAS_TYPE_TIMEOUT Indicates that no user input was received within the specified time-out period.

  pAuthenticationId   Specifies the authentication identifier associated with the current logon session. You can get this value by calling GetTokenInformation to obtain a TOKEN_STATISTICS structure for the token returned by the LogonUser function.
  pLogonSid           On input, this parameter points to a security identifier (SID) that is unique to the current logon session. Winlogon uses this SID to change the protection on the window station and application desktop so that the new logged-on user can access them.
    On output, Winlogon provides an SID. You can also get the SID by using the GetTokenInformation function to retrieve a TOKEN_GROUPS structure for the token returned by the LogonUser function. To do this, search the array returned in the TOKEN_GROUPS structure for the group with the SE_GROUP_LOGON_ID attribute.
  pdwOptions          Pointer to a DWORD that contains the set of logon options. The following option is defined.Value Meaning
  WLX_LOGON_OPT_NO_PROFILE Indicates that Winlogon must not load a profile for the logged-on user. Either the GINA DLL will take care of this activity, or the user does not need a profile.
  phToken             Points to a handle variable. When the logon operation succeeds, set this handle to a token that represents the logged-on user. Use the LogonUser function to get this token, then when the user logs off, Winlogon closes this handle and calls the WlxLogoff function.
    If you need this handle during your WlxLogoff, make a duplicate of the handle before returning it to Winlogon.
  pNprNotifyInfo      Points to an WLX_MPR_NOTIFY_INFO structure that contains domain, user name, and password information for the user. Winlogon will use this information to provide identification and authentication information to network providers.
    The GINA is not required to return password information. Any NULL fields within the structure will be ignored by Winlogon. Use LocalAlloc to allocate each string; Winlogon will free them when they are no longer needed.
    The GINA should provide domain, user, and password values for complete Session Directory functionality. If the password is not provided, Session Directory will require the user to input the password twice before the user is connected to the server.
  pProfile            On return from a successful authentication, the pProfile parameter points to either a WLX_PROFILE_V1_0 or a WLX_PROFILE_V2_0 structure. The first DWORD in the structure indicates which structure it is. Winlogon uses this structure to load the logged-on user's profile, and frees the memory associated with the structure when it no longer needs it.
  Return Values
  If the function fails, it returns zero. If the function succeeds, the return value is:
    WLX_SAS_ACTION_LOGON Indicates a user has logged on.
    WLX_SAS_ACTION_NONE Indicates the logged attempt was unsuccessful or canceled.
    WLX_SAS_ACTION_SHUTDOWN Indicates the user requested that the system be shut down.

  Before calling WlxLoggedOutSAS, Winlogon sets
    - current desktop is the Winlogon desktop.
    - desktop is locked.

  Do not activate the user shell program in WlxLoggedOutSAS.
  The user shell program should always be activated in WlxActivateUserShell.
