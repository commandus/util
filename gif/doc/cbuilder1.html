Some of you (the C++ Builder 1 users notably) may be wondering why this version
of TGIFImage doesn't support C++ Builder 1 as planned... Well, what can I say,
things didn't work out between C++ Builder 1 and me.<BR>
The following are the conclusions of my attempt at porting TGIFImage to C++
Builder 1:

I only have the demo version of C++ Builder 1 that expired december 1997.<BR>
This means that every time I have to test something for compatibility, I have to
set my system clock a year back. I guess this could solve the year 2000 problem
for me, but it's really annoying and it freaks out the time space continuum (I
think it has created a small "worm hole", because my socks are slowly
disappearing one by one).

C++ Builder 1's TBitmap uses DDB's (Device Dependent Bitmaps), not DIBs.<BR>
So does Delphi 2, but appearantly Builder does things sligtly different from
Delphi 2, because the bitmap routines that works with Delphi 2's TBitmap, doesn't
work with C++ Builder 1.

Since the demo version of C++ Builder 1 doesn't include the source of the
graphics.pas unit, I have no way of determining why the Delphi 2 stuff doesn't
work with C++ Builder. I could experiment, but time is limited and to be
honest, I don't think the result would improve the general quality of TGIFImage.

C++ Builder 1 doesn't support all of the Object Pascal features used by
TGIFImage.<BR>
Namely it doesn't support "virtual class methods" which are used when reading
GIF extensions. I could easily modify TGIFImage to only use the language
features supported by C++ Builder 1, but given the fact that so many other
things doesn't work with C++ Builder 1, I decided against it since it would only
complicate things for "the other compilers".

Every time I install C++ Builder 1, it trashes my Delphi 4 and C++ Builder 3
installations.<BR>
I consider this to be a hostile action on C++ Builder's behalf and the third
time I had to reinstall Delphi, I concluded that C++ Builder 1 simply didn't
want me to port TGIFImage to it.
