  Parameters
  hCard        Reference value returned from SCardConnect.
  pioSendPci   Pointer to the protocol header structure for the instruction. This buffer
               is in the format of an SCARD_IO_REQUEST structure, followed by specific protocol
               control information (PCI).
               For the T=0, T=1, and Raw protocols, the PCI structure is constant. smart card subsystem
               supplies a global T=0, T=1, or Raw PCI structure, which you can reference by using
               symbols SCARD_PCI_T0, SCARD_PCI_T1, and SCARD_PCI_RAW respectively.
  pbSendBuffer Pointer to the actual data to be written to the card.
               Note  For T=0, the data parameters are placed into the address pointed to by
               pbSendBuffer according to the following structure:
                record
                  bCla,   // the instruction class
                  bIns,   // the instruction code
                  bP1,    // parameter to the instruction
                  bP2,    // parameter to the instruction
                  bP3: Byte;    // size of I/O transfer
                end;
               data sent to the card should immediately follow the send buffer.
               In the special case where no data is sent to card and no data is
               expected in return, bP3 is not sent.
                Value Meaning
                bCla The T=0 instruction class
                bIns An instruction code in the T=0 instruction class
                bP1, bP2 Reference codes that complete the instruction code
                bP3 The number of data bytes to be transmitted during the command, per ISO 7816-4, Section 8.2.1.

  cbSendLength Length, in bytes, of the pbSendBuffer parameter.
               Note  For T=0, in the special case where no data is sent to the card and no data expected in return, this length must reflect that the bP3 member is not being sent; the length should be sizeof(CmdBytes)  sizeof(BYTE).
  pioRecvPci   [in, out] Pointer to the protocol header structure for the instruction, followed by a buffer in which to receive any returned protocol control information (PCI) specific to the protocol in use. This parameter can be NULL if no PCI is returned.
  pbRecvBuffer [out] Pointer to any data returned from the card.
               Note  For T=0, the data is immediately followed by the SW1 and SW2 status bytes. If no data is returned from the card, then this buffer will only contain the SW1 and SW2 status bytes.
  pcbRecvLength [in, out] Supplies the length, in bytes, of the pbRecvBuffer parameter and receives the actual number of bytes received from the smart card.
               Note  For T=0, the receive buffer must be at least two bytes long to receive the SW1 and SW2 status bytes. If this buffer length is specified as SCARD_AUTOALLOCATE, then pbRecvBuffer is converted to a pointer to a byte pointer and receives the address of a block of memory that contains the structure.

  For the T=0 protocol, the data received back are the SW1 and SW2 status codes, possibly preceded by response data. The following paragraphs provide information about the send and receive buffers used to transfer data and issue a command.
  Sending data to the card To send n bytes of data to the card, where n>0, the send and receive buffers must be formatted as follows.
  The first four bytes of the pbSendBuffer buffer contain the CLA, INS, P1, and P2 values for the T=0 operation. The fifth byte must be set to n: the size, in bytes, of the data to be transferred to the card. The next n bytes must contain the data to be sent to the card.
  The cbSendLength parameter must be set to the size of the T=0 header information (CLA, INS, P1, and P2) plus a byte that contains the length of the data to be transferred (n), plus the size of data to be sent. In this example, this is n+5.
  The pbRecvBuffer will receive the SW1 and SW2 status codes from the operation.
  The pcbRecvLength should be at least two and will be set to two upon return.
  Retrieving data from the card To receive n>0 bytes of data from the card, the send and receive buffers must be formatted as follows.
  The first four bytes of the pbSendBuffer buffer contain the CLA, INS, P1, and P2 values for the T=0 operation. The fifth byte must be set to n: the size, in bytes, of the data to be transferred from the card. If 256 bytes are to be transferred from the card, then this byte must be set to zero.
  The cbSendLength parameter must be set to five, the size of the T=0 header information.
  The pbRecvBuffer will receive the data returned from the card, immediately followed by the SW1 and SW2 status codes from the operation.
  The pcbRecvLength should be at least n+2 and will be set to n+2 upon return.
  Issuing a command without exchanging data To issue a command to the card that does not involve the exchange of data (either sent or received), the send and receive buffers must be formatted as follows.
  The pbSendBuffer buffer must contain the CLA, INS, P1, and P2 values for the T=0 operation. The P3 value is not sent. (This is to differentiate the header from the case where 256 bytes are expected to be returned.)
  The cbSendLength parameter must be set to four, the size of the T=0 header information (CLA, INS, P1, and P2).
  The pbRecvBuffer will receive the SW1 and SW2 status codes from the operation.
  The pcbRecvLength should be at least two and will be set to two upon return.

{ SCardAccessStartedEvent Order: 5 Hint: 2
  returns an event handle when an event signals that the smart card resource manager is started.
  The event-object handle can be specified in a call to one of the wait functions.

  The function returns an event HANDLE if it succeeds or NULL if it fails.
  If the function fails use GetLastError

  The event-object handle returned can be specified in a call to one of the wait
  functions. Do not close the handle returned by this function.
  When you have finished using the handle, decrement the reference count by calling
  the SCardReleaseStartedEvent().
